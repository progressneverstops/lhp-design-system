# Contributing to Lighthouse Portal Design System

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Lighthouse Portal! It's people like you that make LHP a better tool for everyone.

## 🎯 What We're Looking For
We are specifically looking for **UI/UX improvements** to our existing features. This includes:
- **Visual Iterations**: Better color choices, improved typography, or more consistent spacing.
- **Interaction Design**: Smoother transitions, better hover states, and improved feedback loops.
- **Accessibility**: Enhancing screen reader support, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring components look great on all screen sizes.
- **New Variants**: Alternative designs for existing components (e.g., a "Dark Mode" variant).

## 🚫 What We Are NOT Accepting
To protect our core intellectual property and business strategy, we are **not** accepting contributions for:
- **New Features**: Proposals for features not already in our roadmap.
- **Algorithms**: Changes to health calculations, scoring systems, or data processing.
- **Backend Integration**: Actual API implementations or database logic.
- **Business Strategy**: Changes to pricing, revenue models, or partnership plans.

## 🧭 Advanced Area: 3D Body Visualizer (Middle-Ground Guardrails)
The 3D visualizer in this repo is intentionally a **UI/UX + 3D visuals showcase**:
- You *can* contribute visual improvements, layout, interaction patterns, and mesh presentation.
- You *can* contribute new **open-source** mesh variants (with clear provenance/licensing).
- You **cannot** add or infer proprietary morphing logic, formulas, parameter mappings, or “body intelligence” computation.

To help prevent scope drift, the 3D page includes a **“3D Designers Only” acknowledgement overlay**. This is a **guardrail**, not security.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository.
2. **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-improvement-name`.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Follow the [Design Guidelines](./design-patterns/README.md) and [Design Tokens](./design-tokens/README.md).
4. **Test Your Changes**: Use the provided `examples/` folders to verify your UI changes.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Provide a clear description of what you've improved and why.

## 🎨 Design Principles
- **Clarity over Complexity**: Health data should be easy to read at a glance.
- **Holistic Harmony**: Use vibrant, natural colors that reflect our "Food as Medicine" philosophy.
- **User Agency**: Design should empower the user, not overwhelm them.
- **Body Awareness**: Visualizations should help users feel more connected to their body's signals.

## 📝 Code of Conduct
Please be respectful and professional in all interactions. We aim to foster a collaborative and encouraging environment for all designers.

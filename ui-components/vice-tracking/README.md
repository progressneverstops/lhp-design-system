# Vice Tracking Components

Components for monitoring habits, tracking savings (monetary and time), and building healthier replacement routines.

## 🎯 Purpose
The Vice Tracking module is designed to give users visibility into the impact of their habits. By quantifying abstention in terms of money and time saved, it provides tangible motivation for behavioral change.

## 📂 Components
- **ViceSelector**: Dropdown interface for selecting or adding custom habits.
- **ProgressView**: High-level stats including streaks, total abstention days, and accumulated savings.
- **AnalyticsChart**: Visual representation of savings impact (UI mock).
- **ReflectionForm**: Daily qualitative logging for mood and challenges.
- **ReplacementForm**: Suggestions and custom tracking for healthier alternative habits.

## 🎨 Design Notes
- Use **Vibrant Orange (`#ff8c00`)** as the primary accent color to signify energy and transformation.
- Use **Success Green (`#28a745`)** for positive milestones and abstention buttons.
- Cards should have a subtle border (`#e9ecef`) and soft shadow to maintain a clean, professional look.

## 🔒 IP Protection Applied
- All **monetary calculation logic** has been removed.
- **Mock data** is used for all displays.
- **API endpoints** are excluded; components are designed to be state-driven from a parent container.
- No **proprietary habit-breaking strategies** or psychology-based algorithms are included in the public code.

# PR: UI/UX Change (Public Design System)

## Summary
- **What changed**:
- **Why**:
- **Screenshots** (before/after):

## Public Release Gate (Required)
- [ ] **UI-only**: no algorithms, formulas, thresholds, constants, or tuning parameters
- [ ] **No backend**: no real API endpoints, auth flows, tokens, DB details, or server URLs
- [ ] **No private info**: no personal names/emails, no internal company details, no sensitive workflows
- [ ] **Mock data only**: examples use fictional/placeholder data only
- [ ] **No numeric guidance**: no “recommended X–Y” ranges that imply proprietary logic (unless clearly mock and approved)

## Assets & Licensing (Required if assets changed)
- [ ] I added **source + license** links for any new assets (meshes, images, icons, fonts)
- [ ] Assets are not “found on the internet” without provenance
- [ ] Any 3D meshes are explicitly licensed and attributable

## Accessibility & Quality
- [ ] Meets WCAG AAA (visually) contrast expectations
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and focus states remain usable
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified (mobile + desktop)

## Reviewer Rubric (Answerable)
- [ ] A competitor **cannot** rebuild proprietary method from this PR
- [ ] This PR describes **how it looks**, not **how it works**

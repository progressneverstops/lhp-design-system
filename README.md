# 🕯️ Lighthouse Portal - Public Design System

Welcome to the public design system repository for **Lighthouse Portal (LHP)**—a wellness platform relaunching with a focus on design excellence.

## 🎯 What We're Building

Lighthouse Portal is a holistic wellness platform designed to empower individuals and businesses through data-driven health insights, behavioral tracking, and personalized wellness strategies. 

**We're a startup, but weirdly not new.** LHP has evolved from a small internal tool into a comprehensive platform. Now we're relaunching with a commitment to design excellence—and this design system represents our quality bar.

Our philosophy is simple: **Food as medicine first, body awareness second.** We emphasize seasonal eating, sun exposure for natural synthesis, and rhythmic fasting (sunset to sunrise). This design system is the visual manifestation of that philosophy.

## 💼 For Designers

We're building something ambitious and looking for designers who want to:
- **Work on production-quality components** that showcase real design excellence
- **Build a portfolio piece** that gets noticed (quality work gets shared organically)
- **Join a team when we're funded** (quality contributors get first consideration)

**Honest positioning:** We're a startup without budget yet, but quality contributions here are the fastest path to a paid role when we launch. Every component in this system is production-ready, accessible (WCAG AAA), and thoughtfully crafted—this is the level we work at.

**The best way to get noticed:** Contribute a component that matches our quality bar, show you understand our design philosophy, and demonstrate you can work within IP protection constraints.

## 🏗️ Repository Scope

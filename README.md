# 🕯️ Lighthouse Portal - Public Design System

Welcome to the public design system repository for the **Lighthouse Portal (LHP)**.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Lighthouse Portal is a holistic wellness platform designed to empower individuals and businesses through data-driven health insights, behavioral tracking, and personalized wellness strategies. This repository serves as a **collaboration hub for UI/UX designers** to contribute improvements, iterations, and creative adaptations to the visual layer of the LHP ecosystem.

## 📖 The Founder's Story
The Lighthouse Portal was born from a deeply personal mission to transform how we approach health and wellness. 

The journey began with a vision to create a system that addresses the "whole person"—not just tracking calories, but understanding the intricate connections between our environment, our habits (vices), our hydration, and our mental clarity. Inspired by the story of **brother Joshua** and the desire to build something that truly makes a difference, LHP has evolved from a small internal tool into a comprehensive platform.

Our philosophy is simple: **Food as medicine first, body awareness second.** We emphasize seasonal eating, sun exposure for natural synthesis, and rhythmic fasting (sunset to sunrise). This design system is the visual manifestation of that philosophy.

## 🏗️ Repository Scope

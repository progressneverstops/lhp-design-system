# 📚 Lighthouse Portal - Platform Vocabulary

This document defines the standard terminology used across the Lighthouse Portal (LHP) design system and platform. **All contributors must use these terms consistently** to avoid confusion and maintain clarity.

## 👥 People & Roles

### Consumer
The end-user of the Lighthouse Portal platform. A person who uses LHP to track their wellness, habits, and health metrics.

**Usage**: "The consumer logs their daily hydration intake."

**⚠️ Important**: In code, the term `client` may refer to consumers in some contexts, but in documentation and discussions, prefer "consumer" to avoid confusion with wellness clients.

### Wellness Client
A business organization (not an individual) that uses Lighthouse Portal to manage wellness programs for their employees, members, or customers.

**Usage**: "Wellness clients can customize their dashboard branding."

**Note**: This refers to the business entity, not individual staff members within that organization.

### Designer / Contributor
A UI/UX designer who contributes to this public design system repository.

**Usage**: "Contributors should follow the design patterns outlined in `design-patterns/README.md`."

### Maintainer
The core team member(s) responsible for reviewing contributions and maintaining the design system.

## 🏗️ Product Areas & Features

### Vice Tracking
A feature that helps consumers track and modify behavioral habits (e.g., smoking, excessive screen time, etc.).

**Components**: `ViceSelector`, `ProgressView`, `ReflectionForm`, `ReplacementForm`, `AnalyticsChart`

### Hydration Monitoring
A feature for tracking daily water intake and hydration goals.

**Components**: `WaterIntakeForm`, `GoalSettingForm`, `ProgressCircle`, `StatsCard`

### Food & Nutrition
A feature focused on nutrient-dense food logging and exploration, aligned with the "Food as Medicine" philosophy.

**Components**: `FoodSearch`, `FoodLogForm`, `NutritionCard`, `BarcodeScanner`

**Philosophy**: Emphasizes seasonal eating, body awareness, and fasting from sunset to sunrise.

### Workouts
A feature for planning, tracking, and progressing through physical exercise routines.

**Components**: `WorkoutPlanDisplay`, `ExerciseCard`, `ProgressTracker`

### Achievements
A gamification feature that rewards consumers with badges and milestones for reaching wellness goals.

**Components**: `AchievementCard`, `BadgeDisplay`, `ProgressIndicator`

### 3D Body Visualizer
A UI/UX showcase component that displays 3D body meshes with minimal controls (wireframe, pause animation). **UI-only**; no proprietary morphing algorithms.

**Components**: `BodyVisualizer`

**Guardrails**: This component is intentionally stripped of proprietary body intelligence. Contributors can improve visual presentation, layout, and interaction patterns, but **cannot** add morphing logic, parameter calculations, or body intelligence algorithms.

## 📊 Data Types & Concepts

### Log / Entry
A single record of a consumer action (e.g., a food log entry, a hydration entry, a vice tracking entry).

**Usage**: "Each log entry includes a timestamp and relevant metrics."

### Metric
A measurable value tracked over time (e.g., cups of water, hours of sleep, days without a vice).

**Usage**: "The hydration metric is displayed in the stats card."

### Insight
A derived observation or pattern identified from consumer data. **[private/internal]**

**Note**: Insights are generated by proprietary algorithms not included in this repository.

### Score
A calculated value representing a consumer's wellness status (e.g., Vitality Score, Hydration Score). **[private/internal]**

**Note**: Score calculations are proprietary. In this repository, scores are displayed visually but calculated via mock functions.

### Recommendation
A personalized suggestion provided to consumers based on their data. **[private/internal]**

**Note**: Recommendation logic is proprietary. UI components may display recommendations, but the generation logic is not included here.

## 🛡️ Guardrail Terms

### Sanitized
A component or code that has been stripped of proprietary algorithms, business logic, and sensitive data. All components in this repository are sanitized.

**Usage**: "This component is sanitized; it uses mock data and placeholder calculations."

### UI-only
Refers to components that display visual interfaces without underlying business logic or algorithms.

**Usage**: "The 3D Body Visualizer is UI-only; it shows meshes but does not perform body morphing."

### Mock Data
Fictional example data used in components for demonstration purposes. No real consumer data exists in this repository.

**Usage**: "All examples use mock data to protect consumer privacy."

### Algorithmic Secrecy
The principle that proprietary health formulas, calculations, and predictive models are strictly excluded from this repository.

**Usage**: "We maintain algorithmic secrecy by replacing all calculation functions with mock placeholders."

### No-dates Policy
A policy that removes specific years, timeline markers, and launch dates from public-facing documentation to protect business strategy.

**Usage**: "Following the no-dates policy, we removed all specific year references from the roadmap."

## 🎨 Design System Terms

### Design Token
A named value that defines a design decision (e.g., color, spacing, typography). Tokens are stored in JSON files in `design-tokens/`.

**Usage**: "Use the `colors.brand.primary` token instead of hardcoding hex values."

### Component
A reusable UI element (HTML/CSS/JS) that implements a specific interface pattern.

**Usage**: "The `NutritionCard` component displays macro distribution."

### Variant
An alternative visual style or configuration of a component (e.g., "Dark Mode variant", "Compact variant").

**Usage**: "Contributors can propose new variants for existing components."

---

## ♿ Accessibility Terms

### WCAG AAA (visually)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AAA standard for visual contrast. **This repository targets WCAG AAA (visually)** for all text and UI elements.

**Usage**: "All text must meet WCAG AAA (visually) contrast requirements in both light and dark themes."

**Note**: We specify "(visually)" because we focus on visual accessibility; other WCAG AAA criteria (e.g., sign language) may not apply to this design system.

## 🚫 Terms to Avoid

### ❌ "Client" (when referring to consumers)
**Use instead**: "Consumer"

**Why**: "Client" is ambiguous and can be confused with "wellness client" (business organizations).

### ❌ "User" (inconsistent usage)
**Use instead**: "Consumer" (for end-users) or "Wellness Client" (for businesses)

**Why**: "User" is generic and doesn't distinguish between consumers and business entities.

### ❌ "Feature" (when referring to algorithms)
**Use instead**: "Component" or "UI Component"

**Why**: "Feature" implies full functionality including backend logic, which is not included here.
